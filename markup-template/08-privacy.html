										<h3>Collection and use of personal information</h3>
										<p>When you use our Services, we may collect or receive Personal Information about you to provide our services and operate our business.  The types of Personal Information that we may collect about you, and how we use it are:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">User Profile Information:</span>
												In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you. You provide certain Personal Information when you sign up for our Services, including your full name, email address, phone number, home address, gender (Riders and CareDrivers only), password, and photographs (photographs are optional for Ride Organizers and Riders).  You also provide billing or payment related information so we can facilitate payment for Services.  Users may provide emergency contact information for their account, including such contact’s full name, phone number, and relationship.
												<p>Consistent with legal requirements and in order to determine eligibility as a CareDriver, CareDrivers are required to provide government identification documents, including driver’s license numbers and images, birthdate, signature (in some instances), social security number (only required by local regulation), and vehicle and insurance information.  In addition, CareDrivers submit short bios that are shared with Ride Organizers.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Background Check Information:</span>
												Consistent with legal requirements, the Terms of Use, and our safety practices, we collect information required to facilitate CareDrivers’ background checks. This may include information such as driving history or criminal record, and right to work. Where required by law, or upon the voluntary opt-in of a CareDriver, we collect information required to facilitate certain advanced qualifications such as physical examinations, Tuberculosis skin tests, and drug and alcohol testing.  This information is provided by the CareDriver but may be collected and processed by an authorized vendor on our behalf.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Demographic Data:</span>
												We may collect demographic data about Users through surveys.  You provide this information on a voluntary basis.  This information is used to improve our Platform and the Services provided to you.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Communications:</span>
												When you communication with HopSkipDrive through email, phone, text, chat, or otherwise, we retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve our Services.  Consistent with legal requirements, we may record calls placed or received via the Application (such as between CareDrivers and Organizers) and such calls may be recorded and stored by us or a third-party vendor.  We use this information to facilitate the Services, investigate User complaints and claims, and otherwise provide and improve the Services.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Ride Information:</span>
												We collect Personal Information that you provide when you make or accept requests for Rides and otherwise use our Services, such as ride pick-up and drop-off locations, ride times, and ride notes.   The information collected is necessary to provide the Services.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Location-Based Information:</span>
												We automatically collect location-based information through the Application and third-party software, including, but not limited to geographic areas and other traffic and transportation-related data.  For CareDrivers only, we may collect this data when the Application is running in the foreground (Application is open and on-screen) or background (Application open but not on-screen) of your mobile device.  For all other Users, location information is only collected if the Application is running in the foreground.
												<p>Your location information is necessary for the provision of Services.  For example, it is used to match CareDrivers with Organizers who request rides, and to help protect the safety of all Users or members of the public.  Additionally, CareDrivers’ location information and distance travelled is necessary to calculate charges for rides and for insurance.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Promotions and Contests:</span>
												If you participate in a contest or giveaway with us, we may ask you for your email address and/or home number.  We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes mailing address to verify your identity.  In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice.  These contests and the information you provide are voluntary.  We recommend that you read the rules for each contest that you enter.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">User Feedback:</span>
												To the extent you post information in comments in a publicly available area of our Services (e.g., feedback and reviews on the CareDriver and the Ride), it will be available to other Users of the Services who may use it at their discretion.  We may use this information is used to improve our Services and investigate disputes.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Device Information:</span>
												When you download the Application, we automatically collect your device type, your wireless carrier, and a device ID and we associate this with your Personal Information.
												<p>For diagnostic and statistical purposes and to administer our Services, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Use Information:</span>
												As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track Users’ movements around the Services, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Cookies:</span>
												Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.  “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience within our Services .  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept Cookies from our Services for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit.  Consult your browser’s technical information.  If you do not accept Cookies, however, you may not be able to fully experience the personalized and interactive features of our Services.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Pixel Tags:</span>
												In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).  Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users.  In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages.  Pixel Tags also allow us to send email messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to Users.  We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a User.  We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our Users’ Personal Information.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Collection of Information by Advertisers:</span>
												Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Services (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number).  They do this by using Cookies or other technologies.  Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Services and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or pixel tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: <a href="#!">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or <a href="#!">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.
												<p><em>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</em>.  We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that might enable consumers to opt out of tracking on our Site.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Mobile Services:</span>
												We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our Application to your mobile device.  This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you.  Examples of information that may be collected and used include how you use our mobile services(s) and information about the type of device you use.  In addition, in the event our Application crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application.  This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">Analytics Services and Interest-Based Advertising:</span>
												In addition to the tracking technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit our Site or Application.  This includes third party analytics services, including but not limited to Google Analytics (“Analytics Services”), that we engage to help analyze how Users use the Platform, as well as third parties that deliver content or offers.  We may receive reports based on these parties’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis.  We use the information we get from Analytics Services to improve our Platform.  The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Platform (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services.  The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity.  The Analytics Services may also transfer information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf.  Each Analytics Services’ ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services’ Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.  By using our Site, Application and Services, you consent to the collection, use and processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above.  For a full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@hopskipdrive.com" class="mail-link">legal@hopskipdrive.com</a>.  We may also partner with ad companies to support our marketing efforts, including by serving you ads better tailored to your likely interests.  If you don’t want to take advantage of these services, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href="#!">http://www.aboutads.info/</a> or <a href="#!">http://networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>.

Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.

												<span class="text-blue">Contacts:</span>
												If you permit HopSkipDrive to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform in order to invite individuals in your address book to participate in a Carpool, "refer-a-friend" promotion, or other similar program, we may access names and contact information from your address book to facilitate invitations and social interactions that you initiate through our Services and for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy or at the time of consent or collection.  In addition, if you initiate a Carpool through the Services, we may collect the first and last names and either their phone numbers or email addresses and we may use that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

										<h3>Children</h3>
										<p>THE APPLICATION, SITE AND SERVICES ARE NOT DIRECTED TO CHILDREN AND CHILDREN ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO USE OUR SITES AND SERVICES. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.  In connection with your use of the Services, you may have the option to provide us with certain Personal Information of Riders, such as the Rider’s first and last name, phone number and/or photograph.  IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH RIDER IS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, BY PROVIDING SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU (A) REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH RIDER'S PARENT OR GUARDIAN OR THAT YOU HAVE ALL REQUISITE AUTHORITY FROM SUCH RIDER'S PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO PROVIDE US WITH SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION AS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY; (B) HEREBY CONSENT TO OUR COLLECTION, USE AND PROCESSING OF THIS AND OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR SUCH RIDER'S PARENT OR GUARDIAN); (C) ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE WILL DISCLOSE CERTAIN RIDER INFORMATION TO THE DRIVERS WHO PROVIDE YOUR RIDES AND PARTICIPANTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH RIDES.</p>
										<p>CareDrivers will have access to the following information about Riders, including Riders who are children: a masked version of a Rider’s phone number, if provided (the actual phone number will not be visible to CareDrivers); the Rider’s first and last name; the Rider’s photo, if provided; the Rider’s birthdate; as well as information regarding such Rider’s schedule (e.g., the activities that the Rider is engaged in immediately prior to or after the Ride).  If you choose to provide your Rider’s phone number, CareDrivers will be able to communicate directly with Riders, including children under the age of 13, over the course of providing a Ride, via voice call and/or text message through the masked phone number in the Application.  Through the use of the Services, we may also collect indirect location information regarding Riders, including Riders who are children, via the location information we collect from Drivers during a Ride.  Our Enterprise Customers may be able to arrange Rides for your child through the Services.  By using the Services, in connection with such Enterprise Customers arranging Rides for your child, you acknowledge and agree (i) that we may collect Personal Information of your child from such Enterprise Customers and use and process such Personal Information as described herein; and, (ii) that we may disclose your child’s Personal Information to such Enterprise Customers.

										<h3>How we share information</h3>
										<p>
											<span class="text-blue">HOPSKIPDRIVE DOES NOT SELL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND WILL NOT IN THE FUTURE SELL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT PROVIDING A RIGHT TO OPT-OUT.</span>
											Your information may be shared with third parties as described below:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">How we share Personal Information with Users.</span>
												As you know, our Services are designed to connect Ride Organizers and CareDrivers for Rides.  As such, if you are a Ride Organizer, we must share Personal Information about you and the Rider(s) to CareDrivers and if you are a CareDriver, we must share some Personal Information with the Ride Organizer(s) and Rider(s).
												<ul>
													<li>
														<span class="text-blue">Rider and Ride Organizer Information Shared with CareDriver.</span>
														Throughout the duration of the ride, the CareDriver will see the Rider information described in Section 3 above, and the name of the Ride Organizer, with certain protections in place.  When claiming rides, CareDrivers see only the pick up and drop off locations.  Only after the ride has been matched to a CareDriver will the CareDriver see any ride notes provided by the Ride Organizer.  Only upon pick up will the CareDriver see the Rider’s information.  Upon completion of the ride,  Rider information is again masked in the CareDriver’s ride history following the ride.  Once the ride is complete, we will eventually share the Rider or Ride Organizer’s rating and any feedback with the CareDriver.  Although we remove the Rider or Ride Organizer’s identity when doing so, the CareDriver may be able to identify the individual(s) who provided the feedback.  Rider and Ride Organizer phone numbers are masked via in-app communication.  In the case of a lost or found item, we will seek to connect you with the relevant CareDriver or Ride Organizer.  No actual contact information will be shared without your consent.
													</li>
													<li>
														<span class="text-blue">CareDriver Information Shared with Rider(s) and Ride Organizer(s).</span>
														Once a CareDriver accepts a ride request, we will share with the Ride Organizer(s) and Rider(s) (if applicable) the CareDriver’s name, profile photo, short bio, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate.
													</li>
													<li>
														<span class="text-blue">Carpool and Referral Programs.</span>
														If you initiate a Carpool ride or refer someone to the HopSkipDrive Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral.  If another User referred you or invited you into a Carpool, we may share information about your use of the Platform with that User.  For example, a referral source may receive notification regarding participation in a Carpool or receive a bonus when you join the Platform.  During any Carpool Ride each Rider and Rider Organizer may receive information about the other Rider(s) and Ride Organizer(s), including the Rider(s) and Ride Organizer(s) names, trip notes, and pick up or drop off locations for that Carpool Ride.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												<span class="text-blue">How we share Personal Information with Other Parties.</span>
												In addition to the ways we share Personal Information as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may share Personal Information with other third parties in the following manners:
												<ul>

														<span class="text-blue">Payment Processing Information.</span>

													</li>
													<li>
														<span class="text-blue">CareDriver Screening Providers and Resources.</span>
														We work with background check, identity verification, physical exam (where applicable), onboarding, and other required or voluntary CareDriver screening providers.  HopSkipDrive may make available certain tools and resources to CareDrivers for purposes of CareDrivers’ furthering their own independently established trades.  CareDrivers who access or participate in these tools and resources may be required to share certain Personal Information.
													</li>
													<li>
														<span class="text-blue">Consultants and Other Business Service Providers.</span>
														We may share your Personal Information with consultants and other business service providers.  This information is provided in order for them to provide us critical services such as cloud storage, marketing and advertising services, data analytics, insurance and financing services, certain wheelchair or other specialty rides, and other services.  These third-party service providers have access to your Personal Information only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.
													</li>
													<li>
														<span class="text-blue">Affiliates.</span>
														We may share Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (“Corporate Affiliates”), if we have such Corporate Affiliates in the future, in which case we will require our Corporate Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
													</li>
													<li>
														<span class="text-blue">Corporate Restructuring.</span>
														We may share some or all of Personal Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets.

													</li>
													<li>
														<span class="text-blue">Legal Reasons.</span>
														Regardless of any choices you make regarding Personal Information (as described below), we may disclose Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas, warrants or other requests for information served on us; (c) to protect or defend our rights or property or other users of the Services; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our <a href="#!">Terms of Use</a>.
