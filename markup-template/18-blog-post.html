										<p>Many people inquire if we’re ‘Uber or Lyft for kids’.</p>
										<p>And in the age where companies describe themselves as  ‘Uber-izing’ their particular field, we can see why this is a common conception… one we want to correct.</p>
										<p>We are not an ‘Uber for kids’ or a ‘Lyft for kids.’ Those solutions are designed for adults, while our platform is specially designed to arrange transportation for children over the age of six to ride alone.</p>
										<p>Because we provide a solution for youth transportation, we have completely different—and far more rigorous—safety technology and processes. </p>
										<p>Some of the key differences are outlined below. Take a look to find out how, when it comes to a safe youth transportation solution, we’re just right.</p>

										<h2>HopSkipDrive? That’s like Uber or Lyft for kids, right?</h2>
										<p><strong>The short answer is no:</strong> Uber and Lyft provide a convenient, on-demand rideshare solution intended for adults. HopSkipDrive is uniquely designed to arrange transportation for children six and up to ride by themselves with trusted, rigorously vetted CareDrivers. </p>
										<p>The long answer is that HopSkipDrive is a safe, reliable transportation solution for children and anyone who needs a little extra care. This is an enormous responsibility; parents and caretakers place a huge amount of trust in us. Therefore, our technology, support team, processes, CareDriver qualifications, safety measures, and more are specifically created with a laser focus on safety.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="single-post-item">
										<h2>I heard that you have extensive background checks for CareDrivers? Uber and Lyft background check their drivers, too… How is HopSkipDrive different?</h2>
										<p>Uber and Lyft both require background checks and vehicle inspections for their drivers. However, because our platform is used to arrange transportation for minors, we put additional driver vetting processes into place — for one, fingerprint-based background checks.</p>
										<p>In addition, CareDrivers must pass a <strong><a class="text-blue" href="#!">15-point certification</a></strong> to access the HopSkipDrive platform. This includes ensuring a CareDriver has five years of childcare experience, fingerprint-based background checks using FBI and DOJ databases, vehicle inspection (to be repeated annually), and alerts set up for DMV and criminal record monitoring. We meet every CareDriver in person and provide in-person training.</p>
										<p>The critical difference between HopSkipDrive.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="single-post-item">
										<h2>How is HopSkipDrive’s pickup process different than Uber and Lyft’s?</h2>
										<p>HopSkipDrive’s service is intended for kids and riders who need extra care, so we prepare CareDrivers to ensure child safety. Each CareDriver uses a multi-factor authentication to verify they have the correct Rider, and for the Rider to know they’re leaving with the right person. Ride Organizers can fill out extensive Rider profile notes so CareDrivers know about any special needs they may have.</p>
										<p>CareDrivers have booster seats for kids who need them, and drivers will make sure kids are buckled up before departing the pickup location.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="single-post-item">
										<h2>Do CareDrivers know anything about kids? What makes them more qualified than Uber or Lyft drivers?</h2>
										<p>Yes. Not only do CareDrivers go through a more in-depth background check process in order to access the platform, they must have <strong>five years of caregiving experience</strong>. This requirement can be met if they are a parent, or have caregiving experience in a professional capacity such as a teacher, nanny, or daycare worker. </p>
										<p>This helps with the overall ride experience. CareDrivers are used to working with kids and have experience engaging them and making them feel comfortable. They know appropriate topics of conversation, age-appropriate music, and other things that come up along the way when transporting kids. </p>
										<p>Kids appreciate getting to know an adult who is invested in their education, and many districts and counties trust HopSkipDrive to safely transport hundreds of students to and from school. </p>
										<p>“In the past year, HopSkipDrive has provided safe and reliable transportation to school for hundreds of our foster youth,” said Tina Garcia, education specialist at DCFS. “HopSkipDrive provides curb to curb transportation and the CareDrivers are available to personally walk riders to and from the car to ensure safe transfer to a trusted adult.”</p>
										<p>CareDrivers are experienced with childcare and try to ensure riders have all their belongings when dropped off, but HopSkipDrive is also able to easily follow-up with individual CareDrivers if something is left behind on a ride. Our Support team is available to assist in locating the CareDriver with the item. </p>
										<p>We know that with kids, even the smallest of items can have enormously high sentimental value. We can coordinate with the CareDriver and help you in getting back personal items, homework, art projects, and important technology like cell phones if they get left behind. We know even the small things are important to kids, and work hard to reunite them with any item.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="single-post-item">
										<h2>Can I see where my child is when they’re on their HopSkipDrive ride? And what is your Safe Ride Support technology?</h2>
										<p>Our Safe Ride Support technology is a key part of our safety procedures, and totally unique to HopSkipDrive. Through the HopSkipDrive app, parents can monitor their child’s ride in real time and receive alerts as the ride progresses.  </p>
										<p>In addition, HopSkipDrive has developed its Safe Ride Support System.  Safe Ride Support is an integrated solution that provides end-to-end visibility to HopSkipDrive as well as users of the platform.  The system uses innovative technology to monitor trips in real-time for safety-related anomalies.  The Safe Ride Support System flags such anomalies and generates alerts so that the issue can be promptly addressed.  </p>
										<p>In addition, HopSkipDrive works with a leading industry partner that has developed software used to detect certain unsafe driving patterns.  Through this technology, the HopSkipDrive Platform records events of risky driving behaviors like hard braking or speeding. CareDrivers receive weekly safety scores, along with tips and resources to aid in safe driving behavior.</p>
										<p>Tracking, careful vetting, and an obsession with safety remain part of HopSkipDrive’s mission, even as we expand.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="single-post-item">
										<h2>Is it true your rides are scheduled ahead of time, and not offered immediately like Uber or Lyft?</h2>
										<p>Unlike rideshare services like Uber or Lyft, HopSkipDrive rides are booked at least eight hours in advance.</p>
										<p>This advance requirement allows CareDrivers to review the pickup and dropoff notes and Ride Organizers to show the child a CareDriver’s photo and practice the procedure for pickup.</p>
										<p>HopSkipDrive ensures that a member of the Safe Ride Support team is available to live monitor every ride in real time, another reason why planning ahead is key. Our team will do our best to help in any situation, but planning ahead to book regular rides is the ideal way to use HopSkipDrive.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="single-post-item">
										<h2>I’m concerned about having a driver at school pickup, and if my school will allow it. Can CareDrivers comply with school criteria?</h2>
										<p>Some schools have rules against Uber or Lyft pickups on campus, but since we are designed for kids HopSkipDrive is welcomed onto many campuses. Your pickup and dropoff notes can contain any details the CareDriver may need to know about campus procedure, and the CareDriver will follow those notes. These may include checking the child out of the office, collecting a child from a particular adult, and more.</p>
										<p>If your school has specific criteria for staff that extends to CareDrivers, we can help there too. For example, many schools require anyone who works with their students to have specific vaccines or health certifications.</p>
										<p>When we partner with such schools, districts, or <strong><a class="text-blue" href="#!">counties</a></strong>, we limit access to CareDrivers those who meet the criteria. For example, TB certified CareDrivers will provide their medical proof of a TB negative test in order to access those rides. The test isn’t required to drive, but a negative result is required to claim trips where schools mandate it. </p>
										<p>CareDrivers receive initial onboarding information, and additional resources are provided on safe driving,  trauma-informed care, riders with special needs, and more.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="single-post-item">
										<h2>Is there anything else I should know about HopSkipDrive and safety?</h2>
										<p>CareDrivers are not just drivers - they’re caregivers on wheels. HopSkipDrive is able to ensure a consistent experience thanks to the pool of qualified CareDrivers who can access the ride marketplace. </p>
										<p>CareDrivers adhere to TNC regulations, have safe driving records, and their route is monitored every step of the way. Each will verify your child through a code word at pickup, and ensure they’re buckled in using a booster seat if need be.</p>
										<p>They are caring professionals who will engage your child and get them where they need to go safely. </p>
