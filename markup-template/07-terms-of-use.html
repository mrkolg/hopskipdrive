HopSkipDrive reserves the right to modify these Terms, and such modifications shall be binding on you upon your acceptance of the modified Terms. Continued use of the HopSkipDrive Platform to arrange for and/or provide “Services” (defined below) after any such modifications shall constitute your consent to such modifications.

								<strong class="list-head">The HopSkipDrive Platform.</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<span>Generally. HopSkipDrive is a marketplace platform which enables Users to connect, arrange for, and schedule rides for minors and other eligible riders, and provide Services directly to other Users. “Users” refers to and includes (i) independent contractors who use an approved personal vehicle to provide transportation and caregiving services (“CareDrivers”); (ii) “Organizers” (including parents/guardians) and “Enterprise Customers” (including schools, districts, nonprofits and government entities) who need transportation for (a) family members, (b) members of other account-holders’ family, (c) students, (d) clients, and/or (e) other riders for whom they are legally authorized to arrange rides (collectively, “Riders”). Organizers and CareDrivers are free to use the HopSkipDrive Platform to communicate and contract with one another. Transportation and caregiving services provided by CareDrivers to Organizers and Riders who are matched through the Platform shall be referred to collectively as the “Services”. CareDrivers use the HopSkipDrive Platform to advertise their Services to other Users. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Services provided by a CareDriver at the request of an Organizer constitute a separate agreement between such persons. Organizers are responsible for paying CareDrivers for the Services they contract for using the HopSkipDrive Platform.</span>
										<p>HOPSKIPDRIVE DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND IS NOT A TRANSPORTATION COMPANY. As a User, you acknowledge that your ability to arrange for, provide, and/or obtain Services using the HopSkipDrive Platform does not in any way establish HopSkipDrive as a provider of transportation or as a transportation company. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and HopSkipDrive, or between HopSkipDrive and any Enterprise Customer.</p>
									</li>
									<li>Organizers and Riders. Each Organizer will need to create an account in order to access or use the HopSkipDrive Platform. As an Organizer, you have the ability under your account to add Riders for whom you will be arranging Services and to provide certain information about such Riders. For each Rider that you add to your account, you represent and warrant that you have all authorizations, consents, and approvals to provide any information you submit about such Rider. Riders may be added to more than one account (e.g., a parent/guardian and school account).</li>
									<li>Carpool. Shared rides (a “Carpool”) are available through the Application. To initiate a Carpool, an Organizer must invite at least one other Organizer to join the ride. Organizers can set up a single Carpool or recurring Carpools. Each Organizer, as applicable, is responsible for their portion of the fare upon completion of the ride. Organizers can accept multiple Carpools invitations. For more information on Carpools, see here: <a href="#!">https://www.hopskipdrive.com/carpool</a>.</li>
									<li>Additional Features. We are always looking for ways to improve our Platform and may add, change, or remove features or offerings at any time.</li>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, the Open Source Software is not licensed under Section 3(a) and instead is separately licensed pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective open-source software licenses. You agree to comply with the terms and conditions of such open-source software license agreements.</li>
									<li>As a marketplace Platform, we connect CareDrivers with Organizers. For the Platform to work, we need to collect your location information. When you open the Application on your mobile phone, we collect your location information in real-time. Your location information is necessary for the provision of Services. For example, it is used for things like matching CareDrivers with Organizers who request rides, and to help protect the safety of all Users or members of the public. Additionally, CareDrivers’ location information and distance travelled is necessary to calculate charges for rides and for insurance. By using the Application, you hereby authorize us to collect, use, and store your location data even when the Application is running in the background (for CareDrivers only). If you do not agree to permit us to collect this information on your mobile device, you may not use our Services as such collection and use is necessary for the provision of our Services.</li>
									<li>Certain features of the Platform require access to and use of your device's map features or functionality, such as Google Maps, or other third party services. Any use of those features will be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to such third party services. By using the Platform, and depending on your device’s operating system, you may also have to agree to the Google Maps end-user terms located at <a href="#!">http://www.google.com/help/terms_maps.html</a> (as may be changed from time to time by Google). It is your sole responsibility to review the terms and conditions that apply to Google Maps before using it; these Terms do not apply to any activities conducted via the Google Maps site. Likewise, by using the Platform, you may also agree to the Apple end-user terms located at <a href="#!">http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/</a> (as may be changed from time to time by Apple). It is your sole responsibility to review the terms and conditions that apply to Apple mobile devices before using them.</li>
									<li>You understand that the HopSkipDrive Platform is evolving. As a result, HopSkipDrive may require you to accept updates to the Application or other software that you have installed on your computer or mobile device. You acknowledge and agree that HopSkipDrive may update the Application with or without notifying you. You may need to update third party software from time to time in order to use the Platform or Application.</li>

								<strong class="list-head">DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>
								<p class="text-blue">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH HOPSKIPDRIVE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. THIS SECTION 16 OF THE TERMS SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.”</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<span>Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and HopSkipDrive.</span>
										<p><span class="text-blue">YOU AND HOPSKIPDRIVE MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY ARBITRATION</span>, as set forth below. The Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after the Terms terminates or your relationship with HopSkipDrive ends. <span class="text-blue">ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</span> Except as expressly provided below, this Arbitration Agreement applies to all “Claims” (defined below) between you and HopSkipDrive, including our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or shareholders. This Arbitration Agreement also applies to claims between you and HopSkipDrive’s service providers, including but not limited to background check providers and payment processors; and such service providers shall be considered intended third-party beneficiaries of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
										<p>Except as expressly provided below, <span class="text-blue">ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US (EACH A “CLAIM” AND COLLECTIVELY, “CLAIMS”) SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND HOPSKIPDRIVE.</span> These Claims include, but are not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: the Terms and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof), the HopSkipDrive Platform, the Services, any other goods or services made available through the HopSkipDrive Platform, your relationship with HopSkipDrive, the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your User account or the Terms, background checks performed by or on HopSkipDrive’s behalf, drug or alcohol testing, payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any promotions or offers made by HopSkipDrive, any city, county, state or federal wage-hour law, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, emotional distress, breach of any express or implied contract or covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by HopSkipDrive and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance), and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common law claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a Claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.</p>
										<p><span class="text-blue">BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND HOPSKIPDRIVE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</span> This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute that can lawfully be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from the requirement to arbitrate.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.</span>
										<p class="text-blue">YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND HOPSKIPDRIVE MAY EACH BRING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS (“CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU AND HOPSKIPDRIVE BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS SUBSECTION (B) SHALL NOT APPLY TO REPRESENTATIVE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST HOPSKIPDRIVE, WHICH ARE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY IN SECTION 16(C).</p>
										<p>The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.</p>
										<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms, the Arbitration Agreement or the JAMS Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (i) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action, and (ii) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining claims and may be brought in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>Representative PAGA Waiver.</span>
										<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms or the Arbitration Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (i) you and HopSkipDrive agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (ii) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and HopSkipDrive agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms, the Arbitration Agreement or the JAMS Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (a) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from the Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (c) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>Rules Governing the Arbitration.</span>
										<p>Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) pursuant to its General Arbitration Rules & Procedures (“JAMS Rules”) that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. Copies of the JAMS Rules can be obtained at the JAMS’s website (<a href="#!">www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures</a>) or by calling the JAMS at 1-800-352-5267. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of JAMS Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of representative, collective, or class proceeding. The Parties may select a different arbitration administrator upon mutual written agreement.</p>
										<p>As part of the arbitration, both you and HopSkipDrive will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.</p>
										<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Riders or CareDrivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Rider or CareDriver to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>Arbitration Fees and Awards.</span>
										<p>The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant JAMS Rules subject to the following modifications:</p>
										<ol class="numeric-list">
											<li>If you initiate arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement after participating in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k) below and are otherwise required to pay a filing fee under the relevant JAMS Rules, HopSkipDrive agrees that, unless your claim is for $5,000 or more, your share of the filing and arbitration fees is limited to $50, and that, after you submit proof of payment of the filing fee to HopSkipDrive, HopSkipDrive will promptly reimburse you for all but $50 of the filing fee. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.</li>
											<li>If HopSkipDrive initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, HopSkipDrive will pay all JAMS filing and arbitration fees.</li>
											<li>With respect to any Claims brought by HopSkipDrive against a CareDriver, or for Claims brought by a CareDriver against HopSkipDrive that: (i) are based on an alleged employment relationship between HopSkipDrive and a CareDriver; (ii) arise out of, or relate to, HopSkipDrive’s actual deactivation of a CareDriver’s User account or a threat by HopSkipDrive to deactivate a CareDriver’s User account; (iii) arise out of, or relate to, HopSkipDrive’s actual termination of these Terms, or a threat by HopSkipDrive to terminate these Terms; (iv) arise out of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement, including HopSkipDrive’s commission or fees on the Fares), tips, or average hourly guarantees owed by HopSkipDrive to CareDrivers for Services, other than disputes relating to referral bonuses, other HopSkipDrive promotions, or consumer-type disputes, or (v) arise out of or relate to background checks performed in connection with a user seeking to become a CareDriver (the subset of Claims in subsections (i)-(v) shall be collectively referred to as “CareDriver Claims”), HopSkipDrive shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses (to the extent not paid by HopSkipDrive pursuant to the fee provisions above). However, if you are the party initiating the CareDriver Claim, you shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which you provide Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you pursuant to the JAMS Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1) above. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 16(e)(3), the term “CareDriver” shall be deemed to include both CareDrivers and CareDriver applicants who have not been approved to use the Platform.</li>
											<li>Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).</li>
											<li>At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.</li>
											<li>Although under some laws HopSkipDrive may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, HopSkipDrive agrees that it will not seek such an award unless you are represented by an attorney or the arbitrator has determined that the claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.</li>
											<li>If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of HopSkipDrive’s last written settlement offer made after you participated in good faith in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k) below, then HopSkipDrive will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000, whichever is greater.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>Location and Manner of Arbitration.</span>
										<p>Unless you and HopSkipDrive agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between HopSkipDrive and an Organizer (except Enterprise Customers) will take place in the county of your billing address, and any arbitration hearings between HopSkipDrive and a CareDriver will take place in the county in which the CareDriver provides Services. Unless you and HopSkipDrive agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between HopSkipDrive and an Enterprise Customer will take place in Los Angeles, California. If JAMS arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a JAMS arbitration.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>Exceptions to Arbitration.</span>
										<p>This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (i) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; (ii) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 16(c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”); (iii) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; and (iv) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the FAA.</p>
										<p>Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”), or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. However, should you bring an administrative claim, you may only seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to this Arbitration Provision, and you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative complaint, except for a complaint issued by the NLRB. Should you participate in an NLRB proceeding, you may only recover money damages if such recovery does not arise from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision or settled by you. Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this Arbitration Provision if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>Severability.</span>
										<p>In addition to the severability provisions in subsections (c) above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>CareDriver Claims in Pending Settlement.</span>
										<p>If you are a member of a putative class in a class or representative action lawsuit against HopSkipDrive involving CareDriver Claims and a Motion for Preliminary Approval of a Settlement has been filed with the court in that lawsuit prior to this Agreement’s effective date (a “Pending Settlement Action”), then this Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to your CareDriver Claims in that particular class action. Instead, your CareDriver Claims in that Pending Settlement Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you accepted prior to this Agreement’s effective date.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>Opting Out of Arbitration.</span>
										<p>As a CareDriver or CareDriver applicant, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate CareDriver Claims defined in Section 16(e)(3) (except as limited by Section 16(i) above) pursuant to the terms of this subsection if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in HopSkipDrive’s Terms where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your prior arbitration agreement made by this provision in the manner specified below, but opting out of this arbitration provision has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with HopSkipDrive. If you have not previously agreed to such an arbitration provision and do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Agreement To opt out, you must notify HopSkipDrive in writing no later than 30 days after you accept these Terms and become subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your HopSkipDrive User name (if any), the email address you used to set up your User account (if you have one), a CLEAR statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and your handwritten signature. You must send notice of your desire to opt out of arbitration for such CareDriver Claims, which writing must be dated, signed and delivered by: (i) electronic mail to <a href="#!">legal@hopskipdrive.com</a>, or (ii) by US Postal Service certified mail, return receipt requested to:</p>
										<address>
											Legal and Policy<br>
											HopSkipDrive, Inc.<br>
											PO Box 21-423<br>
											Los Angeles, CA 90021
										</address>
										<p>If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other provisions of the Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement will have no effect on any other prior arbitration agreements between you and HopSkipDrive or any future arbitration agreement between you and HopSkipDrive.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span>Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process.</span>
										<p>Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and HopSkipDrive may agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by you and HopSkipDrive. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.</p>

								<strong class="list-head">General.</strong>
								<p>Except as provided in Section 16, any enforcement of or dispute relating to these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of law provision is only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret these Terms and is not intended to create any other substantive right to non-Californians to assert claims under California law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of these Terms. In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of these Terms. You agree that these Terms and all incorporated policies and agreements may be automatically assigned by HopSkipDrive, in our sole discretion by providing notice to you. Except as explicitly stated otherwise, any notices to HopSkipDrive shall be given by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested to HopSkipDrive, Inc., PO Box 21-423, Los Angeles, CA 90021. Any notices to you shall be provided to you through the HopSkipDrive Platform or given to you via the email address or physical address you provide to HopSkipDrive when you create or update your account. A party’s failure to act with respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a waiver of the party’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and HopSkipDrive with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all previous understandings and agreements between the parties, whether oral or written.</p>
